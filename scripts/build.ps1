# Markmiru build script (Windows / PowerShell).
#
# Produces a fully fresh build where the frontend, the Go backend, and the final
# executable all reflect the CURRENT source state in one shot:
#   - The previously generated frontend bundle (frontend/dist) is removed first, so the
#     embedded assets (//go:embed all:frontend/dist) cannot carry over stale files.
#   - wails build then re-runs "npm run build" to regenerate frontend/dist from source,
#     and -clean wipes build/bin so no old artifact is left behind.
#   - Go is recompiled by wails build (its content-addressed cache always tracks source).
#
# Embeds the git short SHA as the version:
#   - Runtime (shown at the end of the "About Markmiru" tab): Go ldflags (-X main.version=<sha>)
#   - OS properties (Explorer > Properties > Details > Product version):
#       temporarily injected into wails.json "info.productVersion".
# wails.json is always restored after the build (no SHA diff is left in the repo).
#
# NOTE: keep this file ASCII-only. PowerShell 5.1 misreads BOM-less UTF-8 with
#       multibyte comments, which can break command parsing. ASCII avoids that.
